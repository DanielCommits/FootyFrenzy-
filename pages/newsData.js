        content: `Girona deservedly beat Barca 4-2 home and away in 2023-24, but they were completely overpowered this time around. Yamal broke the deadlock on the half-hour mark with a composed first-time finish after picking the pocket of a Girona defender just outside the box, and doubled Barca's lead seven minutes later with a perfectly placed first-time shot from a loose ball. These goals looked simple, but only because of the supremely confident manner in which the teenager dispatched them. Yamal now has the end product to match his crowd-pleasing skill and fearlessness on the ball. He's also grafting relentlessly off it, having won the ball back in the final third on eight occasions already this season - more than any other player in La Liga.`,
